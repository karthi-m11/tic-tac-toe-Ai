# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

## About This Project
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player plays against an AI opponent.  
The AI uses a basic version of the Minimax algorithm to evaluate possible moves and choose the best one.  
The AI is designed to be challenging and difficult to defeat.

This project was completed as Task 2 of my internship to understand basic AI concepts, game theory, and search algorithms.

## How the Game Works
- Human player uses **X**
- AI uses **O**
- Players take turns
- The game ends when someone wins or the board is full
- Friendly messages are displayed for winning, losing, or drawing

## Board Positions
The board positions are numbered 0 to 8 as follows:

0 | 1 | 2
--+---+--
3 | 4 | 5
--+---+--
6 | 7 | 8


Use these numbers to choose your move.
